# NeuralNetwork
Overview:
This repository contains an implementation of a neural network model trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), making it a widely used benchmark dataset for machine learning tasks. The neural network model implemented here is designed to classify these handwritten digits into their respective categories.

Key Features:
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The implementation includes functionality to load the MNIST dataset and preprocess it for training. This involves tasks such as normalization, flattening the image arrays, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Neural Network Architecture: The neural network architecture comprises multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. Each layer is implemented using appropriate activation functions and weight initialization techniques to ensure efficient learning.

Training Procedure: The model is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent optimization techniques. The implementation includes methods to forward propagate input data through the network, compute loss functions, and update network parameters based on calculated gradients.

Evaluation and Testing: Once trained, the model is evaluated on a separate testing dataset to assess its performance and accuracy in classifying unseen handwritten digits.

Hyperparameter Tuning: The implementation provides options for hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the learning rate, batch size, and number of hidden units, allowing users to optimize the model's performance based on specific requirements.

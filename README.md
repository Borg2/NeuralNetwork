# NeuralNetwork
This repository contains an implementation of a neural network model trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from (0-9). The neural network model implemented here is designed to classify these handwritten digits into their respective categories.
